## Understanding Debugging
Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors or bugs in your code. It's a crucial part of the development process, helping you ensure that your programs run smoothly and correctly.

**Visuals:**

## Common Types of Errors
There are three main types of errors in programming:
1. **Syntax Errors:** Mistakes in the code structure.
2. **Runtime Errors:** Errors that occur while the program is running.
3. **Logic Errors:** The program runs without crashing but produces incorrect results.

**Visuals:**
- Examples of each type of error with brief descriptions.

## Print Statements for Debugging
One of the simplest and most effective debugging techniques is using print statements to track the flow of your program and check the values of variables.

**Code Example: Using Print Statements**
```python
def divide(a, b):
    print(f"divide called with a={a}, b={b}")
    if b == 0:
        print("Error: Division by zero")
        return None
    result = a / b
    print(f"Result of division: {result}")
    return result

divide(10, 2)
divide(10, 0)
```

**Visuals:**
- Code being written and executed, displaying the output.
- How print statements help track the program's flow and variable values.

## Using Assertions
Assertions are statements that check if a condition is true. If the condition is false, the program will raise an `AssertionError`. They are useful for catching bugs early in the development process.

**Code Example: Using Assertions**
```python
def divide(a, b):
    assert b != 0, "Error: Division by zero"
    return a / b

print(divide(10, 2))
print(divide(10, 0))
```

**Visuals:**
- Code being written and executed, displaying the output.
- How assertions can help catch bugs by verifying assumptions in your code.

## Using the Built-in Debugger (pdb)
Python comes with a built-in debugger called `pdb`. It allows you to set breakpoints, step through your code, and inspect variables.

**Code Example: Using pdb**
```python
import pdb

def divide(a, b):
    pdb.set_trace()  # Set a breakpoint
    if b == 0:
        return "Error: Division by zero"
    return a / b

print(divide(10, 2))
print(divide(10, 0))
```

**Visuals:**
- Code being written and executed, demonstrating the use of `pdb`.
- Basic `pdb` commands: `n` (next), `c` (continue), `q` (quit), `p` (print variable).

## Using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
Many modern IDEs, like PyCharm and VSCode, come with powerful debugging tools. These tools provide graphical interfaces for setting breakpoints, stepping through code, and inspecting variables.

**Example: Debugging in PyCharm**
- Open a Python file in PyCharm.
- Set a breakpoint by clicking in the gutter next to a line of code.
- Run the debugger and step through the code using the debugging toolbar.

**Visuals:**
- PyCharm interface with breakpoints and the debugging toolbar.
- Stepping through the code and inspecting variables.

## Best Practices for Debugging
Here are some best practices for effective debugging:
1. **Reproduce the Bug:** Ensure you can consistently reproduce the bug.
2. **Simplify the Code:** Isolate the problematic code to a small, manageable example.
3. **Use Version Control:** Keep track of changes and revert to previous versions if needed.
4. **Test Incrementally:** Test your code in small increments to catch bugs early.
