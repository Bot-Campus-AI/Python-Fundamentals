# Python OOP Tutorial: Inheritance

## Overview
This tutorial covers the basics of inheritance in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using Python. Inheritance allows us to create new classes from existing classes, helping in reusing code and creating a class hierarchy.

## What is Inheritance?
Inheritance is a way to form new classes using classes that have already been defined. The new class, known as the derived class, inherits attributes and methods from the existing class, called the base class.

## Defining a Base Class
Let's start by defining a simple base class.

**File:** `vehicle.py`
```python
class Vehicle:
    def __init__(self, brand, model):
        self.brand = brand
        self.model = model

    def start_engine(self):
        return "Engine started"

    def stop_engine(self):
        return "Engine stopped"

    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.brand} {self.model}"

# Example usage
vehicle = Vehicle("Generic Brand", "Generic Model")
print(vehicle)
print(vehicle.start_engine())
print(vehicle.stop_engine())
```

## Creating a Derived Class
Now, let's create derived classes that inherit from the base class.

**File:** `bicycle.py`
```python
from vehicle import Vehicle

class Bicycle(Vehicle):
    def __init__(self, brand, model, gear_count):
        super().__init__(brand, model)
        self.gear_count = gear_count

    def ring_bell(self):
        return "Ring ring!"

    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.brand} {self.model} with {self.gear_count} gears"

# Example usage
bicycle = Bicycle("Giant", "Escape 3", 21)
print(bicycle)
print(bicycle.ring_bell())
```

**File:** `car.py`
```python
from vehicle import Vehicle

class Car(Vehicle):
    def __init__(self, brand, model, num_doors):
        super().__init__(brand, model)
        self.num_doors = num_doors

    def play_radio(self):
        return "Playing radio"

    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.brand} {self.model} with {self.num_doors} doors"

# Example usage
car = Car("Toyota", "Corolla", 4)
print(car)
print(car.start_engine())
print(car.play_radio())
print(car.stop_engine())
```

## Inheriting Attributes and Methods
The derived classes inherit all attributes and methods from the base class.

**File:** `car.py`
```python
# The Car class inherits attributes and methods from Vehicle
car = Car("Toyota", "Corolla", 4)
print(car)  # Output: Toyota Corolla with 4 doors
print(car.start_engine())  # Output: Engine started
print(car.play_radio())  # Output: Playing radio
print(car.stop_engine())  # Output: Engine stopped
```

**File:** `bicycle.py`
```python
# The Bicycle class inherits attributes and methods from Vehicle
bicycle = Bicycle("Giant", "Escape 3", 21)
print(bicycle)  # Output: Giant Escape 3 with 21 gears
print(bicycle.ring_bell())  # Output: Ring ring!
```

## Extending Functionality
Let's create derived classes that extend the functionality of the base class.

**File:** `extend_functionality.py`
```python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def speak(self):
        return "This animal makes a sound"

class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return f"{self.name} says Woof Woof"

class Cat(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return f"{self.name} says Meow"

# Creating objects of the derived classes
dog = Dog("Buddy")
cat = Cat("Whiskers")

print(dog.speak())  # Output: Buddy says Woof Woof
print(cat.speak())  # Output: Whiskers says Meow
```

## Understanding `super()`
The `super()` function allows you to call methods from a parent class, which is useful for extending or modifying inherited methods.

**File:** `understanding_super.py`
```python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def speak(self):
        return "This animal makes a sound"

class Dog(Animal):
    def __init__(self, name, breed):
        super().__init__(name)  # Call the parent class's __init__ method
        self.breed = breed

    def speak(self):
        return f"{self.name} the {self.breed} says Woof Woof"

# Creating an object of the derived class
dog = Dog("Buddy", "Golden Retriever")
print(dog.speak())  # Output: Buddy the Golden Retriever says Woof Woof
```

## Summary
In this section, we covered the basics of inheritance in Python. We defined a base class, created derived classes, inherited attributes and methods, extended functionality, and understood the use of the `super()` function. Inheritance helps us write more efficient and maintainable code.

## Next Steps
In the next part of our series, we'll dive into encapsulation, another important OOP concept. Stay tuned!
