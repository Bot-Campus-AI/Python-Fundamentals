# Python Booleans Tutorial

## Overview
This tutorial covers the basics of Python booleans, including how to define, use, and manipulate them. Booleans are crucial for decision-making in code, representing `True` or `False` values. By the end of this tutorial, you will understand how to work with booleans effectively in Python.

## Defining Booleans
In Python, booleans represent one of two values: `True` or `False`.

```python
true_value = True
false_value = False

print(true_value)
print(false_value)
```

## Boolean Expressions
Booleans are often used in expressions that evaluate to `True` or `False`. These expressions are commonly found in conditional statements and loops.

```python
x = 10
y = 5

# Comparison operators
is_greater = x > y  # True
is_equal = x == y  # False

print("x > y:", is_greater)
print("x == y:", is_equal)
```

## Logical Operators
Python provides three logical operators: `and`, `or`, and `not`. These operators are used to combine multiple boolean expressions.

```python
a = True
b = False

# Logical AND
and_operation = a and b  # False

# Logical OR
or_operation = a or b  # True

# Logical NOT
not_operation = not a  # False

print("a AND b:", and_operation)
print("a OR b:", or_operation)
print("NOT a:", not_operation)
```

## Using Booleans in Conditional Statements
Booleans are fundamental in conditional statements, which allow you to execute different code based on certain conditions.

```python
number = 15

if number > 10:
    print("The number is greater than 10.")
else:
    print("The number is not greater than 10.")
```

## Booleans in Loops
Booleans are also used in loops to control how many times a loop should execute.

```python
count = 0

while count < 5:
    print("Count is:", count)
    count += 1
```

## Type Conversion
You can convert other data types to booleans using the `bool()` function. Any non-zero number or non-empty object is considered `True`, while zero, `None`, and empty objects are considered `False`.

```python
# Convert integer to boolean
bool_from_int = bool(1)  # True

# Convert zero to boolean
bool_from_zero = bool(0)  # False

# Convert string to boolean
bool_from_str = bool("Hello")  # True

# Convert empty string to boolean
bool_from_empty_str = bool("")  # False

print("Boolean from integer 1:", bool_from_int)
print("Boolean from integer 0:", bool_from_zero)
print("Boolean from non-empty string:", bool_from_str)
print("Boolean from empty string:", bool_from_empty_str)
```

## Practical Exercise
Create boolean variables and use them in various conditional statements and loops. Try converting different data types to booleans and see the results.
