# Basic Debugging Techniques in Python

## Overview
This tutorial covers basic debugging techniques in Python. Debugging is an essential skill for any programmer, allowing you to identify and fix errors in your code. By the end of this tutorial, you'll understand how to use various debugging techniques and tools to make your code bug-free.

## Understanding Debugging
Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors or bugs in your code. It's a crucial part of the development process, helping you ensure that your programs run smoothly and correctly.

## Common Types of Errors
There are three main types of errors in programming:
1. **Syntax Errors:** Mistakes in the code structure.
2. **Runtime Errors:** Errors that occur while the program is running.
3. **Logic Errors:** The program runs without crashing but produces incorrect results.

## Print Statements for Debugging
One of the simplest and most effective debugging techniques is using print statements to track the flow of your program and check the values of variables.

**Code Example: Using Print Statements**
```python
def divide(a, b):
    print(f"divide called with a={a}, b={b}")
    if b == 0:
        print("Error: Division by zero")
        return None
    result = a / b
    print(f"Result of division: {result}")
    return result

divide(10, 2)
divide(10, 0)
```

## Using Assertions
Assertions are statements that check if a condition is true. If the condition is false, the program will raise an `AssertionError`. They are useful for catching bugs early in the development process.

**Code Example: Using Assertions**
```python
def divide(a, b):
    assert b != 0, "Error: Division by zero"
    return a / b

print(divide(10, 2))
print(divide(10, 0))
```

## Using the Built-in Debugger (pdb)
Python comes with a built-in debugger called `pdb`. It allows you to set breakpoints, step through your code, and inspect variables.

**Code Example: Using pdb**
```python
import pdb

def divide(a, b):
    pdb.set_trace()  # Set a breakpoint
    if b == 0:
        return "Error: Division by zero"
    return a / b

print(divide(10, 2))
print(divide(10, 0))
```
